# K-NN (k nearest neighbours)

kNN is one of the simplest of classification algorithms available for
supervised learning. The idea is to search for closest match of the test data
in feature space.   

k stands for the number of neighbours you will be comparing with.
so if you look for 3 narest neighbours, its 3-nn.   

Pick k as an odd number to break ties.
